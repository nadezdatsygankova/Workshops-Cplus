/*Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 4 on the same line with each pair 
of adjacent numbers separated by one space. Do this several ways:
a) Using one statement with one stream insertion operator.
b) Using one statement with four stream insertion operators.
c) Using four statements.*/

#include <iostream>


int main() {

 

   //one statement with one stream insertion operator
   std::cout << "1 2 3 4\n";

   //one statement with four stream insertion operators

   std::cout << "1 " << "2 " <<  "3 " <<  "4 \n" ;

   //four statements
   std::cout << "1 ";
   std::cout << "2 ";
   std::cout << "3 ";
   std::cout << "4 \n";
